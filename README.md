# Awesome Agent Memory
A curated list of projects on **memory systems of AI agents**.

## Comparing Different Designs

* **[AI Agent Memory Playground](https://github.com/AIAnytime/Agent-Memory-Playground)** – An interactive **evaluation suite** for 9 memory strategies (sequential, retrieval, hierarchical, decay-based, etc.). Includes simulation environment and plots for **token–recall trade-offs** and **forgetting dynamics**. 

* **[Agent Memory Hub](https://agentmemoryhub.vercel.app/)** – A live model directory to search and explore the agent memory ecosystem.


## Standalone Libraries / Frameworks for Building Agent Memory Systems
* **[Vestige](https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige)** - Vestige keeps agent memory on an append-only, hash-chained log. Every write leaves a receipt and every answer names the records behind it. When something breaks, you can walk the chain back to the change that caused it. Local Rust MCP server, no vectors, no RAG.

* **[Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)** – Memory hierarchy with editable **memory blocks**, agentic context tools, **multi-agent shared memory**, and portable **Agent File (.af)** snapshots.

* **[MemMachine](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine)** – Universal memory layer that lets agents **learn/store/recall** user data across sessions, building evolving user profiles. Supports **Working (Short-Term)**, **Persistent (Long-Term)**, and **Personalized (Profile)** memories with developer-friendly APIs (**Python SDK**, **REST**, and **MCP**). Persists **episodic memory** in a graph DB and **profile memory** in an SQL DB.

This enables **dynamic user profiling**, a **three‑layer hierarchical memory** (persona, event and message), **user‑centric retrieval**, and **interaction‑time scaling**.  O‑Mem includes an evaluation suite and exposes modular APIs under the Apache‑2.0 license.

A **Claude Code plugin** that generates complete knowledge systems from conversation — you describe how you think and work, and the engine derives a **cognitive architecture** (folder structure, context files, processing pipeline, hooks, navigation maps, and note templates) tailored to your domain and backed by **249 research claims**. No templates, no configuration — just conversation.

Offers **progressive disclosure** retrieval with token-cost visibility, a **mem-search** skill with hybrid semantic + keyword search, and a local **web viewer UI** for inspecting the memory stream. Includes privacy controls (e.g., `<private>` exclusion) and configurable context injection.

* **[CrewAI – Memory](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/memory)** – Adds **short-term (RAG)** and **long-term** stores (e.g., SQLite backed) so crews **retain insights across executions** and reuse them later.

## Reinforcement-Learning Training for Agent Memory

* **[MemSearcher](https://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher)** – RL-driven search agent that maintains a **compact memory**, fusing each query with memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to keep only task-relevant information (stabilizing context length across long multi-turn runs). Uses **multi-context GRPO** end-to-end RL to jointly optimize reasoning, search, and memory management.

* **[MemEvolve](https://github.com/bingreeky/MemEvolve)** – Meta-evolution framework that jointly evolves an agent’s **memory base and memory architecture** via a dual-loop process, enabling the memory system itself (not just contents) to improve over time. Includes automated **multi-round tournament evolution** with candidate generation, evaluation, and selection; supports optional **Pareto multi-objective** selection.

* **[MemAgent](https://github.com/BytedTsinghua-SIA/MemAgent)** – RL-trained long-context agent with a **memory mechanism** that enables arbitrarily long inputs within fixed windows; **RLVR-based** training and **linear-time** scaling, shown to extrapolate to **multi-million-token** tasks with minimal loss.

* **[MEM1](https://github.com/MIT-MI/MEM1)** – End-to-end RL that learns a **compact internal state** for **constant-memory** long-horizon agents; integrates new observations while discarding redundancy to improve efficiency.

* **[Memento](https://github.com/Agent-on-the-Fly/Memento)** – **Memory-based online RL** over a **memory-augmented MDP** with a **neural case-selection** policy; planner–executor loop reuses past trajectories so agents **learn without fine-tuning** the base LLM.

* **[Memory-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19828)** – the paper (*code not yet publicly available*) proposes an RL framework where a Memory Manager learns to add, update or delete memory entries and an Answer Agent learns to select relevant entries. Both agents are trained with PPO and GRPO to actively manage and utilise an external memory bank.

* **[Mem-α](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25911)** – RL framework that teaches agents how to build and manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. Agents process sequential information, learn to extract and store relevant content, and update core/episodic/semantic memory components; rewards derive from downstream question-answering accuracy.
